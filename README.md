# Robvet - Object Recognition with AWS

## Robvet: Advanced robotic simulator for scenario development | Erasmus+ KA220-VET Project

# What is Robvet?

The main objective of the Robvet project is to develop educational material that responds directly to the current needs of the labour market. This material will be focused on meeting real employment demands and will be implemented in vocational training centres. Specifically, we will focus on training cycles related to the professional families of electricity and electronics, computing and communications, as well as installations and maintenance.

The purpose of the project is to offer innovative activities that are better adapted to contemporary challenges. This includes robotics exercises that focus especially on the simulation of robotic environments supported by artificial intelligence technologies. This approach aims to prepare students with practical and theoretical skills relevant to current and future employment opportunities.
